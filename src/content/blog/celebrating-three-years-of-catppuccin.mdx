Welcome to Catppuccin's first blog post! We'll try our best to publish important
announcements, devlogs, general musings and more.

## 3 years already...

Today, 5th December 2024, is the 3rd anniversary of the <Link
href="https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/releases/tag/v0.1.0"
external>v0.1.0</Link> GitHub release of Catppuccin. I don't think anyone
expected to see Catppuccin grow like it has over these years. 

## Thank you \<3
