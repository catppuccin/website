Catppuccin is a community-driven pastel theme that aims to be the middle ground between low and high contrast themes. It consists of 4 soothing warm palettes with 26 eye-candy colors each, perfect for coding, designing, and much more! In addition, this repository tracks the development of the actual color palette, <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/tree/dev/docs"><b>the project's documentation</b></a>, organization-wide assets, resources and code samples for maintainers/developers.

### üß† Design Philosophy

- **Colorful is better than colorless**: the colorfulness of something contributes to the distinction amongst the parts of that _something_, making it marginally easier to understand how things are structured.
- **There should be balance**: not too dull, not too bright. Suitability under various light conditions is a must.
- **Harmony is superior to dissonance**: vivacious colors must complement each other.
