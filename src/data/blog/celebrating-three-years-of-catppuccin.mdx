Welcome to Catppuccin's first (and very short) blog post! We'll try our best to
publish important announcements, devlogs, general musings and more.

## Happy 3rd Anniversary

Three years ago today, 5th December 2021, [Pocco](https://github.com/pocco81)
created the
[v0.1.0](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/releases/tag/v0.1.0) GitHub
release.

Pocco is the creator of Catppuccin. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the time to
contribute to this theme anymore, but he's still around now and then so make
sure to say hi if you see him!

I don't think anyone could have predicted how popular Catppuccin would become,
going from a simple theme built for Neovim to supporting over 394 applications
and userstyles contributed by people all over the world.

## Thank You

I sincerely believe that time is the most valuable resource that you can offer
someone, **you can't get it back ;)**

Thank you to anyone who's contributed a pull request or raised an issue, our
active maintainers who have committed to maintaining a port, and of course all
the people who continue to use the theme today!

Here's to another amazing year \<3

### P.S

Lookout for the "State of Catppuccin 2024" post, where I'll take a look back on
what Catppuccin achieved in the past year and what to expect in 2025!
