You may or may not have already noticed it: The small arrow we used to indicate links that link a target outside of catppuccin.com is gone. For us this has been quite a tough decision as we grew quite attached to the little guy.


## An ambigious little bugger

This kind of iconography has been around for ages but it has kinda gotten out of use in recent years and as it turns out this is not just because people don't like it. If you come to think of it.. what does it _actually_ indicate?
Does it indicate an external link – _like we used it on this website_ – or would it indicate that the link – _no matter the domain_ – opens in a new tab – or... _both_?

## Issues with development in our website system

Initially we wrapped our links inside a custom Astro component which takes `external` as a prop and depending on that it would add a `span` including the `↗` character.

So far, so good.. but if we look at the website footer now we can find the Vercel badge – that's an external link. Okay.. so one edge case, we just wrap it inside a regular anchor tag and because there is no text for that link we don't miss out on the styling from our custom component.

Then the ports and maintainers arrived. Now we suddently had long lists that all contained external links. No biggie for [community](/community) but on the [ports](/ports) page the arrow was really out of place. Just another place where we use a regular anchor tag, right? At least that how we handled it.

Far from pretty and as we recently went through our codebase we decided to clean up everything which also came with the decision to use the link component wherever we have links; and suddenly the issue came flooding in.


### Links that have content other than plain text

Likely our biggest offender: Images inside links. To avoid it we need to specify CSS that applies to `anchor` tags which include graphics and ensure that we don't get the arrow icon (as well as removing the underline effect).

Oh, right; The port cards also are links so let's wrap them inside our link component! Aaand we get a weird dangling arrow trailing underneath the card layout. Let's extend our override – luckily we can use the same as for images because they should act the same.

And since link styling was scoped to the component – let's throw in a little `:global()` just for good measure.

```scss
a:global(:has(img, svg, .port-card)) {
  text-decoration: none;

  > span.external {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```
Thanks, I hate it!


### Links in blog posts

The next big thing was the release of our blog. Suddenly we had a place where our content was written in Markdown. By default the Markdown compiler obviously just uses regular anchor tags so if we were to use links with a target outside of catppuccin.com we obviously wouldn't have the indicator icon.

Out first idea was to just place the icon through CSS and ditch the custom link component.
```scss
a[href^="https://"]::after {
  content: '\2197';
}
```
That works **but** the setup for overrides just got even more complicated with this – so let's not do it.

An amazing feature that comes with Astro and MDX is that you can specify custom components to replace default HTML mappings – oh, wait: You can't pass props. What if we just change the link component to have a check for external URLs? That's exactly what we did:
```svelte
{#snippet externalLinkIcon()}
  {#if externalIcon}
    <span class="external">&#x2197;</span>
  {/if}
{/snippet}

{#if !href.includes(domain) && !href.startsWith("/") && !href.startsWith("#")}
  <a {href} class:muted class:underline>
    {@render children()}{@render externalLinkIcon()}
  </a>
  [...]
{/if}
```
We're kinda doubling the overhead by both having the `externalIcon` prop which overwrites the added icon in case we don't want it, and the check whether or not the target URL is an external one.

And suddenly we're a million overrides and conditionals deep down in a mess that's really annoying to work with.

This prompted us to just remove the icon in order to re-simplify our codebase and overhead for writing code and content.

Farewell little guy! You will be missed. 💔
