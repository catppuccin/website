Having felt quite inspired by Spotify Wrapped last year, I whipped up a short
[presentation](https://github.com/catppuccin/community/blob/main/presentations/state-of-catppuccin-2023.pdf)
to showcase statistics, highlight achievements and set loose goals for 2024.
Everyone will be glad to hear that I won't be creating presentations anymore
and instead use the blog to share this information.

Let's see how we did in 2024 and compare them to 2023!
